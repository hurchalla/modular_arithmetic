# The Clockwork Modular Arithmetic library

![Alt text](images/clockxtrasmall_border2.jpg?raw=true "Clock Gears, photo by Krzysztof Golik, licensed CC BY-SA 4.0")

Clockwork is a high performance, easy to use Modular Arithmetic library for C++ provided as a "header-only" library, supporting up to 128 bit integer types, and providing extensive support for Montgomery arithmetic.  If you want or need Montgomery arithmetic in this range, or general modular arithmetic functions, Clockwork is almost certainly the fastest and easiest library you could use.  

The library requires only C++11, and works with all higher versions of the C++ standard.

## Design goals

Clockwork is designed to be a flexible and bulletproof library with the best performance achievable for modular arithmetic using standard C++ language integer types (e.g. uint32_t or uint64_t) and the language extension types \_\_uint128_t and \_\_int128_t.  Larger than 128 bit types are permissible by [specialization](https://github.com/hurchalla/util/blob/master/include/hurchalla/util/traits/ut_numeric_limits.h); however a library like [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) is likely to be a better choice for such sizes.

## Requirements

The Clockwork library requires only compiler support for C++11, which is essentially supported universally at this point.  

Compilers that are confirmed to build this library without warnings or errors on Ubuntu linux (x64) include clang6, clang10, clang18, gcc7, gcc10, gcc13, and intel compiler 19.  On Windows, Microsoft Visual C++ 2017, 2019, 2022 are all confirmed to build the library without warnings or errors.  On MacOS, clang16 and gcc14 are confirmed to build without warnings or errors.  The library is intended for use on all architectures (e.g. x86/64, ARM, RISC-V), but has so far been tested only with x86, x64 (Windows and Ubuntu), and ARM64 (MacOS).

## Status

Released.  All planned functionality and unit tests are finished and working correctly.

## How to use the library

### With CMake

If you're using CMake for your project and you wish to add the Clockwork modular arithmetic library to it, then clone this git repository onto your system.  In your project's CMakeLists.txt file, add the following two lines with appropriate changes to their italic portions to match your project and paths ( an easy replacement for *your_binary_dir* is ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} ):  
add_subdirectory(*path_of_the_cloned_modular_arithmetic_repository* &nbsp; *your_binary_dir*/modular_arithmetic)  
target_link_libraries(*your_project_target_name* &nbsp; hurchalla_modular_arithmetic)  

It may help to see a simple [example project with CMake](examples/example_with_cmake).

### Without CMake

If you're not using CMake for your project, you'll need to install Clockwork's modular arithmetic headers and its dependencies to some directory in order to use them.  To do this, first clone this git repository onto your system.  You'll need to have CMake (at least temporarily) on your system, so install CMake if you don't have it.  Then from your shell run the following commands:  

>cd *path_of_the_cloned_modular_arithmetic_repository*  
>mkdir tmp  
>cd tmp  
>cmake -S.. -B.  
>cmake --install . --prefix *the_folder_you_want_to_install_to*  
If you prefer, for the last command you could instead use CMake's default install location (on linux this is /usr/local) by omitting the --prefix and subsequent folder.  

This will copy all the files needed for this modular arithmetic library to an "include" subfolder in the installation folder of your choosing.
When compiling your project, you'll of course need to ensure that you have that include subfolder as part of your include path.  

It may help to see a simple [example](examples/example_without_cmake).

## The API

Clockwork modular arithmetic is a header-only library, and the API is exposed by very short and simple header files (all headers not under any *detail* folder).  There are two main folder groupings: montgomery_arithmetic, and modular_arithmetic (i.e. standard non-montgomery).  A quick summary of the header files and functions is provided below; in all cases T is a template parameter of integral type.  Please view the header files for their documentation.  Probably the single most useful file is MontgomeryForm.h, discussed below.

From the modular_arithmetic group, the files *absolute_value_difference.h*, *modular_addition.h*, *modular_subtraction.h*, *modular_multiplication.h*, *modular_multiplicative_inverse.h*, and *modular_pow.h* provide the following functions, using standard (non-Montgomery) modular arithmetic:

*hurchalla::absolute_value_difference(T a, T b)*.  Returns the absolute value of (a-b), performed as if a and b are infinite precision signed ints.  
*hurchalla::modular_subtraction_prereduced_inputs(T a, T b, T modulus)*.  Let a conceptual "%%" operator represent a modulo operator that always returns a non-negative remainder. This function returns (a-b) %% modulus, performed as if a and b are infinite precision signed ints.  
*hurchalla::modular_addition_prereduced_inputs(T a, T b, T modulus)*.  Returns (a+b)%modulus, performed as if a and b have infinite precision and thus as if (a+b) is never subject to integer overflow.  
*hurchalla::modular_multiplication_prereduced_inputs(T a, T b, T modulus)*.   Returns (a\*b)%modulus, performed as if a and b have infinite precision.  
*hurchalla::modular_multiplicative_inverse(T a, T modulus)*.  Returns the multiplicative inverse of a if it exists, and otherwise returns 0.  
*hurchalla::modular_pow(T base, T exponent, T modulus)*.  Returns the modular exponentiation of base to the exponent (mod modulus).  

From the montgomery_arithmetic group, the file *MontgomeryForm.h* provides the easy to use (and zero cost abstraction) class *hurchalla::MontgomeryForm*, which has simple member functions for performing operations in the Montgomery domain.  These operations include converting to/from Montgomery domain, add, subtract, multiply, square, [fused-multiply-add/sub](https://jeffhurchalla.com/2022/05/01/the-montgomery-multiply-accumulate), pow, gcd, and more.  For improved performance, if you can guarantee your modulus will be under half or under a quarter of the maximum value of your integer type T, the file *montgomery_form_aliases.h* provides aliases of the class MontgomeryForm which typically run ~5-10% faster.

For an easy demonstration of MontgomeryForm, you can see one of the [examples](examples/example_without_cmake).

If you prefer not to use the high level interface of MontgomeryForm, and instead wish to directly call low level Montgomery arithmetic functions (such as REDC), the API header files within montgomery_arithmetic/low_level_api provide the essential low level functions.

## Performance Notes

If you're interested in experimenting, predefining certain macros when compiling might improve performance - see [macros_for_performance.md](macros_for_performance.md).
