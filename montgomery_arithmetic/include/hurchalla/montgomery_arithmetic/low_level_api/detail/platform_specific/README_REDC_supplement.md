The simplest and usually most effective way to implement the traditional REDC is to write a delegating function that calls the alternate REDC.  With inlining, its total uops will likely be lower than the low-uops asm version further below, and there is a decent chance that the compiler will loop hoist the calculation of invN if we are calling this function from a loop.  Thus this version could also achieve latency equal to the low-latency asm version further below.  In practice, even if the negation is not loop hoisted, REDC will most often be called during Montgomery multiplication, and the negation will not contribute to latency since its calculation will overlap with the preceding multiply in the Montgomery multiplication.  Yet another reason why we might prefer this implementation is that the delegate "REDC_alternate" function can be implemented effectively with just standard C, which would eliminate the chance of inline-asm related bugs, and will sometimes improve performance since inline-asm may hinder compiler optimizations.<br>

<pre>
// On Intel Skylake: ~9-10 cycles latency, ~8 fused uops
inline uint64_t REDC_traditional_delegating(uint64_t T_hi, uint64_t T_lo,
                                                   uint64_t N, uint64_t negInvN)
{
    uint64_t invN = -negInvN;
    return REDC_alternate(T_hi, T_lo, N, invN);
}
</pre>
<i>Delegating Function for the Traditional REDC</i>
<br><br>

There is usually no need to read further unless you are curious.

We can improve upon the inline assembly we saw in the main document for the traditional REDC, though the code becomes harder to understand.  The improvements also can't be implemented well in standard C; none of the major compilers (gcc, clang, MSVC, icc) are able to compile standard C versions of the functions below without adding significant extra latency and uops, even with idiomatic use of the ternary operator for conditional move.

Since the alternate REDC function from [README_REDC.md](README_REDC.md) does better on uops and equals or betters the latency, all while being easier to understand, and friendlier for compilers if written in standard C, we should certainly prefer the alternate REDC to the functions that follow.  Nevertheless the functions below do improve the traditional REDC inline asm, so they could be useful as an easy drop-in replacement of an existing REDC function (which will almost certainly be traditional REDC with the negative inverse), or they might be interesting for anyone curious.

The improved functions below are correct and produce output equivalent to the previous inline asm we saw for the traditional REDC.  You can find a rough proof of correctness in comments of the C++ function ["REDC(T u_hi, T u_lo, T n, T neg_inv_n, FullrangeTag, InplaceLowlatencyTag)" of an old git commit](https://github.com/hurchalla/modular_arithmetic/blob/66281af1639031b04bdaf9b916e5d5638d3ded25/montgomery_arithmetic/include/hurchalla/montgomery_arithmetic/detail/platform_specific/RedcLargeR.h#L365).

The first function below is optimized for lowest latency(REDC_traditional_improved1).  The second is optimized for lowest uops (REDC_traditional_improved2):</br>

// On Intel Skylake: 9 cycles latency, 11 fused uops

{
    assert(T_hi < N);   // REDC requires T < NR, and this enforces it.
