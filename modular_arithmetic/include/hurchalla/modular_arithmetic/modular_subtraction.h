// Performance note #1 (signed vs. unsigned T):
//   On some systems, this function may perform better when T is signed than
// when it is unsigned.  Specifically, when HURCHALLA_AVOID_CSELECT is defined
// (see hurchalla/util/compiler_macros.h) a signed type can perform better; if
// it is not defined you should expect no performance difference between signed
// and unsigned.
//
// Performance note #2 (modular addition vs modular subtraction):
//   You can generally expect that the assembly for a modular subtraction will
// never use more total operations (it will likely use less) than a modular
// addition.  You can also expect that the assembly for modular subtraction will
// never use more total registers (it will likely use less) than modular
// addition.
//   In favor of addition, you can generally expect that the assembly for
// modular addition will never have higher total latency (it will possibly be
// lower) than modular subtraction.
//   This comparison is written based on the performance of x86 architecture.
// If possible, these relative performance characteristic will be maintained
// across architectures and into the future (but this is not guaranteed).
//
// If you will be adding or subtracting the same value over every iteration of
// a loop, then if you wish, you can convert a loop's add into a subtract, or a
// subtract into an add.  You can do this by negating the relevant operand prior
// to loop start.  Purely as an example, if you have the loop:
//      for (int i=0; i<total; ++i)
//          x = modular_addition_prereduced_inputs(x, b, modulus);
// you can change it to:
//      T c = modular_subtraction_prereduced_inputs(0, b, modulus);  // negate b
//      for (int i=0; i<total; ++i)
//          x = modular_subtraction_prereduced_inputs(x, c, modulus);
