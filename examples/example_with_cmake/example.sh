# This example is meant to show how to use the modular arithmetic library within
# a CMake project.  If you haven't already done so, you should follow the steps
# in the README.md for "How to use the library" | "With CMake"

# Note that using CMake with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release will ensure that the
# standard macro NDEBUG (see <cassert>) is defined, which is essential for best
# performance.

mkdir -p tmp
cmake -S. -B./tmp -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
