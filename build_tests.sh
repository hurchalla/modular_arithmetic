# Description of this script -----------
# This is my working rough-draft script for invoking the testing builds and
# then running the tests.
# The syntax is 
# ./build_tests [-c<compiler_name>] [-r] [-a] [-m<Release|Debug>]
#
# -c allows you to select the compiler, rather than using the default.
# -r specifies to run all tests after the build.  Without -r, no tests will run.
# -a specifies you want to compile the code using typically helpful (how much it
#    helps depends on your compiler) inline asm optimizations, which makes for
#    the fastest binaries but of course has the downsides of inline asm -
#    primarily that inline asm is extremely difficult to properly test.
# -t specifies that you want to compile the code using all available inline asm
#    routines, simply for the purpose of testing them all - this is not expected
#    to result in the fastest binaries.
# -m allows you to choose between Release and Debug build configuration, rather
#    than using the default.
#
# Currently it supports clang, gcc, and icc but you'll need to customize the
# section under "#Compiler commands" to match the compilers on your system.  The
# script doesn't do anything fancy like auto detection or anything like that.
#
# Some examples of using the script:
# ./build_tests.sh -cicc -r -mrelease
# [The above line uses the intel compiler (icc) in a release config, and
# runs the tests after they're built.  No inline assembly is used in the build.]
#
# ./build_tests.sh -cclang -r -a
# [The above line uses the clang compiler in the default config (Debug), and
# runs the tests after they're built.  Inline assembly is used for the build
# wherever possible.]
#
# ./build_tests.sh -cgcc -mdebug
# [The above line uses the gcc compiler in a debug config.  Although it builds
# the tests, it does not run any of them.  No inline assembly is used.]

# You get the Intel C++ compiler by downloading/installing Parallel Studio XE.
# It is free to install and use for open source projects.  See-
#   https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/qualify-for-free-software.html#opensourcecontributor
# After installing intel compiler on Ubuntu (I used Parallel Studio XE 2020
# Update1 Professional Edition), I did:
# ----------------
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt upgrade
# source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
#   [ Whenever you wish to compile with Intel C++ (icc/icpc), you will need to
#     first run this compilervars script.  Probably you could set up your system
#     so that compilervars.sh runs at boot time and so that its effects apply to
#     any shell you start, but I would recommend *against* doing so.  The
#     compilervars script alters the PATH environment variable and puts some
#     intel bin directories as the first entries in the PATH.  Unfortunately
#     those bin directories contain clang, clang++, gcc, and g++ symbolic links
#     to (evidently) binaries that the Parallel Studio XE installer put on the
#     system.  This seems to me to be a bad choice by intel, because after
#     sourcing the compilervars script, the commands gcc, g++, clang, clang++ no
#     longer refer to any of the gcc or clang compilers that you may have
#     installed on your system.  Instead these commands will refer to the intel-
#     provided gcc/clang compilers, which will likely be a completely different
#     version of those compilers from what you expect or want.
#     The solution to this problem I am using is to start a subshell, then
#     source compilervars.sh, then perform the compilation with icc, then exit
#     back to the parent shell.  The commands I use to do this are:
#          bash
#          source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
#          ... run icc, or run cmake with icc, etc ...
#          exit
#     Any running script is already in a subshell (unless you use source or . ),
#     so creating another subshell isn't necessary.  This present script here
#     assumes it is already in a subshell, and just sources compilervars.sh if
#     icc is chosen. ]
# sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
#   [ The above problems with compilervars.sh weren't my only issues.  For
#     whatever reason, I have experienced that the intel version of gcc/g++ is
#     not always the one used after I have sourced compilervars.sh, presumably
#     because the script altered the PATH variable to place the intel compiler
#     directories *after* usr/bin where the normal gcc/g++ on my system lies.
#     This is a problem for icc, because Intel C++ uses and needs gcc's system
#     includes and standard library: see  https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/cpp-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference/top/compatibility-and-portability/gcc-compatibility-and-interoperability.html
#     If icc mistakenly ends up using a version of gcc (for example, the very
#     latest version of gcc) that is not compatible with icc, then icc may fail
#     with compile errors that make it pretty obvious it is using your system
#     gcc rather than the intel-placed gcc.  Therefore, the default version of
#     gcc that is invoked by the commands 'gcc' and 'g++' *MUST NOT* be more
#     recent than your installation of Intel C++ supports.  I don't know what
#     the most recent gcc version is that icc from Parallel Studio XE 2020 (icc
#     v19.1) supports, but I know that when update-alternatives was set to
#     gcc-10 I had errors when I tried to compile icc with -std=c++17, and I
#     know that when I set update-alternatives to gcc-7 all the errors with
#     -std=c++17 went away.  Everything has worked fine for me with IntelC++
#     after I set the default 'gcc' and 'g++' to be version 7.  I would guess
#     that none of this is an issue if/when compilervars.sh places the intel
#     directories as the first entries in PATH, but I don't know.  I'm not sure
#     why compilervars.sh seems to be inconsistent about entry placement in PATH
#     for me.  Regardless, for whatever version of gcc that you are currently
#     using as the system default (via update-alteratives), you'll have to try
#     compiling with icc using -std=c++17 in order to know if your default gcc
#     version is making icc vulnerable to compile errors.  For example, with
#     this present script here when using icc, if you start getting unexpected
#     compile errors when you change this script's line that sets cpp_standard
#     to use cpp_standard="-std=c++17", then you'll know you need to default to
#     an older gcc version (via update-alternatives).  Either that, or figure
#     out how to make sure compilervars.sh always consistently places the intel
#     directories first in PATH. ]
# sudo update-alternatives --config g++
#   [ You *MUST* set the default g++ to be the same version as you just chose
#     for update-alternatives --config gcc.  For me, that meant g++-7. ]
#
# [ I didn't need to run "update-alternatives --config icc" (or icpc), but if
#   you install multiple versions of icc, then I expect you'd need to run
#   update-alternatives for both icc and icpc. ]

cpp_standard="-std=c++11"

# A long note about issues setting the C++ standard when using CMake
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# In this bash file we're setting up the C++ standard as a compiler argument.
# This is not a normal or recommended method.  The normal/recommended method
# would be to set the standard in CMakeLists.txt.  However, in practice doing it
# that way is difficult to get to reliably work right for testing purposes, and
# more generally, it introduces potential issues with mixed standards.  For
# reference--- getting CMake to handle the standard would require two lines in
# CMakeLists.txt:
#    target_compile_features(MyTarget INTERFACE cxx_std_14)
#    set_target_properties(MyTarget PROPERTIES CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)
# We'd need the second line since gcc will use -std=gnu++14 instead of
# -std=c++14, unless we turn off CXX_EXTENSIONS.  But these two things are still
# not enough in some circumstances: if we use cxx_std_11 instead of cxx_std_14
# above, cmake won't use any flags for the compiler standard for gcc (at least
# this is what I saw for gcc version 7) and this means that gcc will use gnu++11
# by default -- even though we specified cxx_std_11 and set CXX_EXTENSIONS off.
# It was at this point I gave up on setting the C++ standard within CMake.
#
# Instead, strictly for testing, I'm setting the standard as a compiler argument
# that gets passed to CMake.  Keep in mind that setting the standard via the
# command line is *only* done for testing.  My library CMakeLists.txt specifies
# nothing for the standard, and it will thus compile using whatever standard has
# been set (or has been defaulted) by a CMakeLists.txt that is using/consuming
# the library.  For these tests, the consuming CMakeLists.txt is
# test/CMakeLists.txt, but this CMakeLists.txt happens to be a special case of
# testing, where I need precise control of the standard and thus for the reasons
# given above I do it via compiler arguments.
#
# In principle it'd be easy to argue that my library CMakeLists.txt ought to
# specify that it needs at least C++11, and that it should do this via
# target_compile_features, but I have reasons above and below that go against
# doing that, and in practice in 2020 it would be fairly unusual for someone to
# use a C++ compiler (or to set the compiler standard in a way) that doesn't
# support C++11.  In such a case the worst thing that would happen, during
# compilation, is that the library would compile with errors that would probably
# be obvious missing C++11 features.  It'd much easier to make the argument that
# I ought to specify the standard in CMakeLists.txt for a library that needs
# C++17 or C++ 20, simply because it's much less likely (in 2020) that a
# compiler would happen to be set to use a high enough standard.  I'd still
# consider the related problem below though, even in that case.
# 
# A related problem is that setting the standard in my library's CMakeLists.txt
# could potentially lead to multiple standards being used to compile different
# parts of someone's project (e.g. C++11 for one library target and C++17 for
# another target, which then get linked together).  Although it'd be unusual for
# a problem to result from this, it isn't a good idea, and if/when it causes a
# problem it won't be obvious what went wrong.  So I avoid setting the standard
# anywhere in the CMakeLists.txt for the libraries I produce. There will still
# remain some scenarios where the standards could get mixed, but this reduces
# the exposure to it and it prevents my CMakeLists.txt from being a contributing
# cause of it.  For info on how/why mixing the standard could potentially result
# in errors, see:
